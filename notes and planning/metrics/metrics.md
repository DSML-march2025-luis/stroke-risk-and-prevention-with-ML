# Metrics that will be used

1. Primary Metric: Brier Score
    - Goal: measure probability accuracy
    
2. Mandatory Checks:
    - a) Calibration Curve + ECE
        - Goal: Validate Calibration 
    - b) AUC-ROC or AUPRC 
        - Goal: Verify Discrimination (i.e. ensure that the model can discriminate well between high and low-risk patients)
